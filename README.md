# Capstone

This is my Capstone project for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.  It's a practical tool for carrying out a variety of common statistical calculations and doing so quickly and interactively.  Soon it will also be available for free on the app store.  Thanks for looking!

# Features

The following statistics utilities make up the app currently -- and more are on the way!

* An interactive version of **z- and t- tables**.  Translate between p-values and z- or t-scores at the touch of a button.  No more hunting through dense pages of numbers in a grid, or worrying about rounding your degrees of freedom.

* A dynamic plot of the **standard normal distribution**.  This distribution is the keystone of any intro stat course.  Set a z-score to see the corresponding p-value in context and easily toggle between left- and right-tailed areas.

* A **random number generator**.  *I'm thinking of a normally distributed value that comes from a distribution with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation of 3.14159 ...* Now your device can too!  In this utility a shake-gesture will produce random values following the normal distribution, uniform distribution, or random integers (like rolling a dice with n sides).

* **Enter your own data**.  Pinch and swipe gestures allow you to quickly create and edit a data set of your own. Once you have entered at least three values, a pull-down gesture (like refreshing your email inbox) will instantly bring up a data summary that includes the mean, variance, standard deviation, and five-number-summary for your data set.  Your data set is automatically saved so that the next time you use the app it will still be there.

* **Chat with the developer** and see what other users are saying too.  A live, familiar-looking chat interface connects you with other people interested in statistics.  This is a great place to suggest new app features to the developer (me).

There is also a basic calculator included in case you don't want to switch between apps or grab another device, e.g. when you just need to check your arithmetic or take a quick square root.
